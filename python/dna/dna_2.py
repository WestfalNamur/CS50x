# An STR is a short sequence of DNA bases that tends to repeat consecutively
# numerous times at specific locations inside of a personâ€™s DNA. The
# number of times any particular STR repeats varies a lot among individuals.
# In the DNA samples below, for example, Alice has the STR AGAT repeated four
# times in her DNA, while Bob has the same STR repeated five times.
#
# In the DNA samples below, for example, Alice has the STR AGAT repeated
# four times in her DNA, while Bob has the same STR repeated five times.
#   Alice:  CTAGATAGATAGATGACTA
#   Bob:    CTAGATAGATAGATAGATAGATT
#
# Specification:
#   1.  * Program should require as its first command-line argument the name of
#       a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals and
#       should require as its second command-line argument the name of a text
#       file containing the DNA sequence to identify.
#       * If your program is executed with the incorrect number of command-line
#       arguments, your program should print an error message of your choice
#       (with print). If the correct number of arguments are provided, you may
#       assume that the first argument is indeed the filename of a valid CSV file,
#       and that the second argument is the filename of a valid text file.
#   2.  * Your program should open the CSV file and read its contents into
#       memory.
#       * You may assume that the first row of the CSV file will be the column
#       names. The first column will be the word name and the remaining columns
#       will be the STR sequences themselves.
#   3.  * Your program should open the DNA sequence and read its contents into
#       memory.
#   4.  * For each of the STRs (from the first line of the CSV file), your
#       program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of the
#       STR in the DNA sequence to identify.
